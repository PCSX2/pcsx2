# Introduction to SDL with Xcode

The easiest way to use SDL is to include it as a subproject in your project.

We'll start by creating a simple project to build and run [hello.c](hello.c)

- Create a new project in Xcode, using the App template and selecting Objective C as the language
- Remove the .h and .m files that were automatically added to the project
- Remove the main storyboard that was automatically added to the project
- On iOS projects, select the project, select the main target, select the Info tab, look for "Custom iOS Target Properties", and remove "Main storyboard base file name" and "Application Scene Manifest"
- Right click the project and select "Add Files to [project]", navigate to the SDL docs directory and add the file hello.c
- Right click the project and select "Add Files to [project]", navigate to the SDL Xcode/SDL directory and add SDL.xcodeproj
- Select the project, select the main target, select the General tab, look for "Frameworks, Libraries, and Embedded Content", and add SDL3.framework
- Build and run!
