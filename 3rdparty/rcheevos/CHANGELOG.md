  * rurl has been removed (deprecated in v10.0.0)
* trigger parsing/processing code has been largely modified to improve processing performance
  * AddAddress/AddSource chains can now be shared across triggers to avoid recalculating them multiple times
  * triggers are preprocessed to allocate conditions as array instead of linked list. 
    - array is sorted such that similar conditions (pause/reset/hittarget/etc) can be processed together
      without having to scan the linked list multiple times
    - the linked list still exists for backwards compatibility and to maintain the original ordering  
  * each condition type has its own handler, eliminating many switches and branches when processing triggers
  * memrefs are now allocated in arrays (eliminating the linked list pointer from each to reduce memory footprint)
* commas are now inserted into all numeric formats except SCORE. a new format type UNFORMATTED (@Unformatted) has
  been added to display a number without commas.
  - To forcibly exclude commas in a backwards-compatible way, use the @Unformatted macro and define Unformatted as
    a VALUE formatter. Legacy clients will use the VALUE formatted and new clients will use the @Unformatted macro.
