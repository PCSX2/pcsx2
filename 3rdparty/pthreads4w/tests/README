Running test cases in this directory
------------------------------------

These make scripts expect to be able to copy the dll, library
and header files from this directory's parent directory,
which should be the Pthreads4w source directory.

MS VC nmake
-------------

Run the target corresponding to the DLL version being tested:
 
nmake clean VC
 
or:
 
nmake clean VS


GNU GCC make
------------

Run "make clean" and then "make". See the "Known bugs" section
in ..\README.


Writing Test Cases
------------------

Tests written in this test suite should behave in the following manner:

	* If a test fails, leave main() with a result of 1.

	* If a test succeeds, leave main() with a result of 0.

	* No diagnostic output should appear when the test is succeeding
	  unless it is particularly useful to visualise test behaviour.
	  Diagnostic output should be emitted if something in the test
	  fails, to help determine the cause of the test failure. Use assert()
	  for all API calls if possible.

Notes:
------

Many test cases use knowledge of implementation internals which are supposed
to be opaque to portable applications. These should not be used as examples
of methods that can be conformantly applied to application code.
