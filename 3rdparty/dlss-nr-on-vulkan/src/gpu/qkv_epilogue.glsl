/*
 * qkv_epilogue — the QKV projection finished where it is computed.
 *
 * Without it the projection goes to memory as float32, (window, token, 3, head, 32), and
 * three passes read it back: two cosine publishes for Q and K and a split for V, each
 * ending in E4M3 in (window, head, token, 32) order. At block 0 of a 720p frame that is
 * 377 MB written and read three times over, and 19 ms of the block. Here the workgroup
 * already holds a 32-column block of the output — exactly one head of one of Q, K or V,
 * since the column block is 32 wide and 32-aligned — so it can normalise and publish it
 * before anything leaves the chip.
 *
 * Bit-identical to the three passes by construction: the input is the same float32
 * accumulator they would have read back, the reciprocal norm is `cosine_tree.glsl`'s one
 * definition, and the per-element steps are cosine_publish's and the split's, in their
 * order. `src/gpu/test_gemm_qkv.py`.
 *
 * The includer provides `stage` (the raw accumulator block, row-major, BN wide) and its
 * element type as `QKV_STAGE`, BM and BN, `qkv_barrier()`, and a push block with `n`, `c`,
 * `d`, `residual_cos`, `qkv_scale`, `image_h` and `image_w`. The operands, which have no other use in this mode:
 *   c    Q target        d    K target        residual_cos    V target
 *   qkv_scale   the query's per-head scale (float32)
 *   image_h     tokens per window             image_w         heads

/* No shared memory of its own, and that is load-bearing. Workgroup shared memory is
 * allocated in powers of two on this hardware: the tiled block's `stage` is exactly 2 KB,
 * and a 64-byte array of reciprocals beside it made every tiled GEMM's workgroup take
 * 4 KB — halving how many fit on a core, for every tiled GEMM in the graph whether it used
 * this epilogue or not. That cost 23 ms of a 720p frame before it was found. So each row
 * is normalised in place, in `stage`, and the publish happens in the store loop. */
