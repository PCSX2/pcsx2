"""
nr_frame_resident — the whole 71-block graph on the device.

`nr_resident` records a block; this records a frame. Activations never come back to
the host: the stem writes a device buffer, every block, transition and skip reads and
writes device buffers, and only the head is read out.

Levels, for a network extent (H, W). The encoder halves five times and the decoder
mirrors it; the two deepest transitions pad to a multiple of the window first.

    L0  H     x W      C=32     block 0, and block 70 at the end
    L1  H/2   x W/2    C=32     blocks 1-3,   67-69
    L2  H/4   x W/4    C=64     blocks 5-7,   63-65
    L3  H/8   x W/8    C=128    blocks 9-13,  57-61
    L4  H/16  x W/16   C=256    blocks 15-21, 49-55
    L5  pad8(L4)/2     C=512    blocks 23-30, 40-47
    L6  pad8(L5)/2     C=1024   blocks 31-38, every token attending to every other

A block is safe writing over its own input — its target is touched only by the final
residual, after every read of the source — so a level needs one value buffer, not two.
