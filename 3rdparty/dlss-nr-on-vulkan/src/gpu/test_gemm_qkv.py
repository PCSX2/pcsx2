"""The QKV projection's epilogue against the projection plus the three passes it replaces.

Reference: the GEMM into float32, `cosine_publish` for Q (with its head's scale) and K,
`split_heads` with the E4M3 publish for V — the graph's own path. Fused: `gemm_qkv`. The
three targets must match byte for byte, and the guard values past their ends must
survive. Both GEMM paths the epilogue lives in are exercised: the register-tiled one
(C below 128, or rows that are not whole 64-row blocks) and the staged one.
