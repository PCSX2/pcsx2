/*
 * libd3dmx — libxmx on Direct3D 12: the same entry points, the same contract, driving
 * Windows' own graphics API instead of Vulkan.
 *
 * Every `xmx_*` symbol in `xmx.h` is here, so `nr_frame.c`, `xmx.py` and `xmxres.py` bind
 * this library exactly as they bind libxmx (`NR_GPU_BACKEND=d3d12` makes them). Shader
 * names stay the SPIR-V names: `xmx_init("gemm_coopmat.spv")` runs the DXIL kernel this
 * library resolves that name to, from the table compiled into this binary
 * (`nr_dxil_embedded.h`, bin2c over the `.dxil` files dxc writes); a path is reduced to its
 * base name and looked up the same way, `XMX_DXIL_DIR=/dir` loads `<dir>/<kernel>.dxil`
 * files instead of the embedded modules, and a path with a directory in it that exists is
 * loaded as a DXIL file outright (the `XMX_*_SPV` overrides, for experiments).
 *
 * What maps onto what:
 *
 *   VkBuffer + device address     ID3D12Resource, its GPU virtual address bound as a *root
 *                                 UAV* (no descriptor heap: `SetComputeRootUnorderedAccessView`
 *                                 takes the address), and the operand's byte offset inside
 *                                 it in the same 128-byte push block the SPIR-V takes (eight operands: u0..u7), folded
 *                                 element offsets included. HLSL has no pointer to dereference,
 *                                 so the resource and the offset travel apart where Vulkan
 *                                 sends one address; `nr_d3d.hlsli` says how a kernel reads it.
 *   memory types                  heaps. On a cache-coherent UMA device (an integrated GPU)
 *                                 the graph's buffers are a CUSTOM heap in L0 with WRITE_BACK
 *                                 pages: cached, mapped, one pool — what HOST_CACHED was on the
 *                                 Xe2 APU, so `xmx_buf_ptr` is the mapping. On a discrete card
 *                                 (or under XMX_STAGING=1) they are DEFAULT-heap resources the
 *                                 host cannot address and reaches through UPLOAD / READBACK
 *                                 staging copies (`notes/phase65`). The buffers the host reads
 *                                 or writes (kinds 1 and 2) are always the WRITE_BACK kind — on
 *                                 a discrete card that is system memory, the trade `libxmx.c`
 *                                 makes for the head's strided readback.
 *   VK_KHR_cooperative_matrix     nothing. HLSL has no shipped matrix-matrix operation: the
 *                                 SM 6.8 WaveMatrix preview was withdrawn before release and
 *                                 SM 6.9's `linalg` is matrix-vector. Every GEMM here runs on
 *                                 the multiply-add kernels (`gemm_portable*.hlsl`); the
 *                                 cooperative-matrix names resolve to them, `xmx_coopmat()` is
 *                                 0 and `xmx_portable()` is 1 (`kernel_alias` below).
 *   specialization constant 0     nothing either: DXIL is compiled ahead of time and there is
 *                                 no shader compiler at run time, so the flags always come
 *                                 from the push block. `xmx_specialize` accepts the mask and
 *                                 `xmx_specialized_count()` stays 0.
 *   push constants                `SetComputeRoot32BitConstants`, 32 words at b0 (128 bytes).
 *   vkCmdPipelineBarrier          a UAV barrier (`D3D12_RESOURCE_BARRIER_TYPE_UAV`, no
 *                                 resource) between passes — the same places, suppressed by
 *                                 `xmx_sync(0)` the same way — and transition barriers around
 *                                 a copy, from the state this recording last left each buffer
 *                                 in (buffers decay to COMMON when a list completes, so every
 *                                 list starts from COMMON and the first use promotes).
 *   vkCmdCopyBuffer               `CopyBufferRegion`.
 *   a recorded command buffer     a command list: closed at submit, executed as often as
 *                                 wanted, so a captured graph *is* its list (each with its own
 *                                 allocator, which must not be reset under it).
 *   vkCmdWriteTimestamp           `EndQuery(TIMESTAMP)` after every pass, resolved into a
 *                                 READBACK buffer at the end of the list.
 *   vkCmdDispatch                 `Dispatch`, in pieces of at most 65535 groups along one
 *                                 axis (`D3D12_CS_DISPATCH_MAX_THREAD_GROUPS_PER_DIMENSION`;
 *                                 Vulkan on the measured drivers took the whole count). The
 *                                 kernel adds the piece's first group, sent in the push block's
 *                                 `spare` word, to its group id.
 *   xmx_adopt                     a host's ID3D12Device and ID3D12CommandQueue, in the `dev`
 *                                 and `q` arguments; the Vulkan-only arguments must be NULL.
 *
 * Numerics are the shaders' business: `precise` where the GLSL has it, `f32tof16` on every
 * narrow store. Nothing here changes a value.
 *
 * The device must offer Shader Model 6.2 and native 16-bit shader operations
 * (`D3D12_FEATURE_DATA_D3D12_OPTIONS4::Native16BitShaderOpsSupported`) — the half loads and
 * stores need them, as the SPIR-V needs `shaderFloat16` and `storageBuffer16BitAccess` —
 * or `xmx_open` refuses and says so. d3d12.dll and dxgi.dll are loaded at run time, so the
 * library links no import library and the static archive (libdlssnr) brings none.
 *
 * Build (Windows only): cl /O2 /LD libd3dmx.c, or the MinGW equivalent; CMake does it.
