xmxres — the device-resident runtime: buffers that persist, dispatches that batch.

`xmx.py` runs one GEMM per submit and hands the result back to the host, which is
why the XMX path does not beat a good CPU BLAS: a 720p frame moves 16.46 GB across
the boundary and 62x the kernel's own time goes into the trip
(`notes/phase11-what-is-left.md`, `notes/phase13-torch-and-blas.md`).

Here the operands are device buffers addressed by pointer, the elementwise passes
run on the GPU too, and a whole chain records into one command buffer with a single
fence at the end. Because the APU's memory is shared and HOST_CACHED, a buffer's
contents are also a numpy array — `Buffer.view()` — so feeding an input or reading
an output is an address, not a transfer.
