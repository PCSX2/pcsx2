/*
 * nr_d3d.hlsli — what every HLSL kernel here shares: the push block, the four operands,
 * the vendor's rounding points (`publish.glsl`, ported) and the typed access behind a
 * byte offset.
 *
 * These kernels are the GLSL of the `.comp` files in `src/gpu/` written in HLSL, pass for
 * pass and flag for flag, so `libd3dmx` can take the very calls `libxmx` takes. The
 * contract is the numerics, not the syntax:
 *
 *   - `half_round` is `f16tof32(f32tof16(x))`: two real conversion instructions, round to
 *     nearest even with half subnormals kept, as `packHalf2x16` / `unpackHalf2x16` are in
 *     the GLSL. Every narrow store goes through `f32tof16` as well, so what lands in a
 *     float16 buffer is the very value `half_round` would have given — no dependence on
 *     what a driver does for an `fptrunc`.
 *   - `precise` is spelled exactly where the GLSL spells it. D3D lets a driver contract a
 *     multiply and an add into one FMA unless the expression is precise, and the gate
 *     rounds to half between its multiply and its add: a fused pair skips that rounding
 *     and moves every E4M3 publish downstream (`notes/phase67` measured it through
 *     Metal's fast math). The rest of the arithmetic is left to the driver, as it is in
 *     the SPIR-V.
 *   - `round()` is round-to-nearest-even in HLSL (DXIL `Round_ne`), the `roundEven` the
 *     E4M3 quantiser needs.
 *
 * The operands. The SPIR-V takes four 64-bit device addresses in the push constants; HLSL
 * has no pointer to dereference, so the runtime binds each operand's *resource* as a root
 * UAV (u0..u3, a GPU virtual address and nothing else — no descriptor heap) and the push
 * block carries the byte offset of the operand inside it, element offsets folded in by the
 * runtime as libxmx folds them into the address. `pc.oa.x` is that offset for `a`; the high
 * word is zero (no buffer here is 4 GB). A kernel reads `a[i]` as `ld_f32(bufA, pc.oa.x, i)`.
 * The alignment tests the GLSL makes on the address it makes on the offset: a resource's
 * address is 64 KB aligned, so the offset's low bits are the address's.
 *
 * The fifth to eighth operands (u4..u7) are bound the same way, the fifth's and sixth's
 * offsets at push offsets 96 and 120 and the seventh's and eighth's in p0 and p2; see below.
 * The fifth and sixth operands (u4, u5) are bound the same way, their offsets at push
 * offsets 96 and 120; a pass that has no use for one still finds a dummy resource there.
 *
 * `spare`, unused by the SPIR-V, is the first group of this dispatch along the split axis:
 * D3D12 caps a dispatch at 65535 groups per axis and the graph's widest passes exceed it,
 * so `libd3dmx` issues them in pieces and each kernel adds `pc.spare` to its group id —
 * the row groups (`SV_GroupID.y`) in the GEMMs, the element groups (`.x`) everywhere else.
