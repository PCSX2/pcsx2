"""Withdrawn claims must not survive outside the notes that withdrew them.

A withdrawn number is not a typo. It is a claim that was published, checked, found false,
and corrected — and then went on being published somewhere nobody looked. This project has
done it twice: `phase40` found five places in the *code* still asserting a bug that had been
retired, and `phase61`'s corrected parameter count outlived its correction in `bench.py`
for two days, where a stranger on other hardware read it and quoted it back.

`notes/` is exempt: it is the record of how the answer was reached, and a note that says
"this was wrong" has to be able to say what was wrong. Everywhere else — the code, the
README, the architecture — a withdrawn claim may appear only beside its correction, on the
same line or the two around it, so that a reader meeting it also meets the retraction.
