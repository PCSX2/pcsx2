"""Render the generated parts of the README, so the manual cannot drift from the program.

Two blocks: the knobs, and the measured frame times. Both come from `nr_knobs`, which the
control tools read as well, so the page and the programs cannot disagree.

    python3 src/tools/knob_doc.py            print them
    python3 src/tools/knob_doc.py --check    exit 1 if README.md is out of date
    python3 src/tools/knob_doc.py --write    put them back into README.md

`test_toggle.py` runs the check, so a knob added to `nr_knobs` and not to the README is a
failing test rather than a surprise for whoever reads the README next. The rates table is
here for a worse reason: the hand-written one survived the host passes moving to C and was
understating this machine by a third, and at 1080p by half, for a week.
