"""Every knob the daemon has, described once.

The control tool, the panel and the documentation all render this table, so a knob
cannot exist in one and be missing from another — which has happened: `hold` went into
the daemon and never into `nr-ctl`, and nothing noticed until a test compared the two.

`summary` is what a panel shows next to the value. `detail` is what a user choosing a
value needs: what the knob does, what the ends of its range do and where to start. Both
are general — no scene or game a reader cannot see. The measurements behind them live in
`notes/`, where they can be checked.
