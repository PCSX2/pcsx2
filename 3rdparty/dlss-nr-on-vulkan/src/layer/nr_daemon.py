nr_daemon — runs DLSS-NR for the Vulkan layer.

The layer is a shared object inside the game's process and the implementation is
Python, so the frame crosses a Unix socket rather than a function call. For a photo
mode that costs nothing: the game is meant to stall while the frame is being looked
at. A per-frame pass would need the graph ported to C.
