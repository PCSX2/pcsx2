"""The layer inside a real `vkQueuePresentKHR`, on a surface that needs no screen.

Everything else about the layer had a test and this did not: the copy out, the copy back,
and who waits for whom. It took a game, so it was never run — and the first time it was, it
found that `present_now` called itself, which is a stack overflow on the first present of
any application. That is what this file is for.

`work/test_present` (C) presents 2N frames through a headless swapchain with the layer in
the chain; this drives it against a stand-in daemon and checks both directions:

  - the first pass clears each image to a colour carrying the frame number, and the daemon
    must be handed exactly that. Copying before the clear has finished — a missing wait —
    shows up as the previous contents.
  - the second pass records nothing, so each image still holds what the layer wrote into it
    last time round, and the daemon must be handed its own answer back.

The default and legacy `NR_LAYER_SYNC=semaphore` alias now both use present waits
and private copy fences. A separate draw queue and delayed final clear expose a
missing wait. --negative-control builds a temporary faulty layer and requires
incorrect captured pixels in three runs of each alias; the production library is
never changed. A device without separate presentation support cannot run that control.
