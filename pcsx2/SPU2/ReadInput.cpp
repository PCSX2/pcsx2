// Core 0 Input is "SPDIF mode" - Source audio is AC3 compressed.

// Core 1 Input is "CDDA mode" - Source audio data is 32 bits.
// PS2 note:  Very! few PS2 games use this mode.  Some PSX games used it, however no
// *known* PS2 game does since it was likely only available if the game was recorded to CD
// media (ie, not available in DVD mode, which almost all PS2 games use).  Plus PS2 games
// generally prefer to use ADPCM streaming audio since they need as much storage space as
// possible for FMVs and high-def textures.
