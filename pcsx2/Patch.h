// Note about terminology:
// "Patch" in PCSX2 terminology refers to a single pnach style patch line, e.g. `patch=1,EE,001110e0,word,00000000`
// Such patches can appear in several places:
//  - At the "patches" folder or on the "patches.zip file inside the 'resources' folder
//    - UI name: "Patch", Controlled via Per-Game Settings -> Patches
//  - At the "cheats" folder
//    - UI name: "Cheats", Controlled via Per-Game Settings -> Cheats -> Enable Cheat
//  - At GameIndex.yaml inside a [patches] section
//    - UI name: "Enable Compatibility Patches", controlled via Advanced section -> Enable compatability settings
// Note: The file name has to be exactly "<Serial>_<CRC>.pnach" (For example "SLPS-25399_CD62245A.pnach")
// Note #2: the old sytle of cheats are also supported but arent supported by the UI

	// "place" is the first number at a pnach line (patch=<place>,...), e.g.:
	// - patch=1,EE,001110e0,word,00000000 <-- place is 1
	// - patch=0,EE,0010BC88,word,48468800 <-- place is 0
	// In PCSX2 it indicates how/when/where the patch line should be applied. If
	// place is not one of the supported values then the patch line is never applied.
	// PCSX2 currently supports the following values:
	// 0 - apply the patch line once on game boot/startup
	// 1 - apply the patch line continuously (technically - on every vsync)
	// 2 - effect of 0 and 1 combined, see below
	// Note:
	// - while it may seem that a value of 1 does the same as 0, but also later
	//   continues to apply the patch on every vsync - it's not.
	//   The current (and past) behavior is that these patches are applied at different
	//   places at the code, and it's possible, depending on circumstances, that 0 patches
	//   will get applied before the first vsync and therefore earlier than 1 patches.
	// - There's no "place" value which indicates to apply both once on startup
	//   and then also continuously, however such behavior can be achieved by
	//   duplicating the line where one has a 0 place and the other has a 1 place.
