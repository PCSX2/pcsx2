// A lock-free queue for a single-consumer, single-producer architecture.
// The queue is also wait-free in the common path (except if more memory
// needs to be allocated, in which case malloc is called).
// Allocates memory sparingly (O(lg(n) times, amortized), and only once if
// the original maximum size estimate is never exceeded.
// Tested on x86/x64 processors, but semantics should be correct for all
// architectures (given the right implementations in atomicops.h), provided
// that aligned integer and pointer accesses are naturally atomic.
// Note that there should only be one consumer thread and producer thread;
// Switching roles of the threads, or using multiple consecutive threads for
// one role, is not safe unless properly synchronized.
// Using the queue exclusively from one thread is fine, though a bit silly.

	// Design: Based on a queue-of-queues. The low-level queues are just
	// circular buffers with front and tail indices indicating where the
	// next element to dequeue is and where the next element can be enqueued,
	// respectively. Each low-level queue is called a "block". Each block
	// wastes exactly one element's worth of space to keep the design simple
	// (if front == tail then the queue is empty, and can't be full).
	// The high-level queue is a circular linked list of blocks; again there
	// is a front and tail, but this time they are pointers to the blocks.
	// The front block is where the next element to be dequeued is, provided
	// the block is not empty. The back block is where elements are to be
	// enqueued, provided the block is not full.
	// The producer thread owns all the tail indices/pointers. The consumer
	// thread owns all the front indices/pointers. Both threads read each
	// other's variables, but only the owning thread updates them. E.g. After
	// the consumer reads the producer's tail, the tail may change before the
	// consumer is done dequeuing an object, but the consumer knows the tail
	// will never go backwards, only forwards.
	// If there is no room to enqueue an object, an additional block (of
	// equal size to the last block) is added. Blocks are never removed.
